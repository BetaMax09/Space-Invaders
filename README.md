# Space Invaders
A fun re-imagining of the 1978 classic by Tomohiro Nishikado and Taito.

Play it here: https://spaceinvaders.viperfish.com.au

Play in the traditional 2D mode or in 3D. The 3D mode is the same game with the camera floating below the player. Both modes are 3D from a different perspective.
Have also added a mode that attempts to emulate an old CRT monitor. With scanlines and a slight glow.

This project was built over a few weeks in Javascript using the BabylonJS framework. ViteJS is used as a build tool.

The repository includes all code, blender models and images. Have fun and use them as you like.
